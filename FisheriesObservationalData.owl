In contrast to previous versions developed through SSN and in conjunction with ISO 19150-2, this ontology has minimal dependencies on existing ontologies, particularly those that trigger extended chains of imports. Stub classes are provided for time, geometry and measure (scaled number), which can be substituted at run-time by a suitable concrete representation of the concept. 
Observation Collection has been (re-)introduced, to support the common case where a collection is homogeneous in one or more properties (feature-of-interest, phenomenon-time, observed-property, units-of-measure, procedure). The value of the common property may be recorded against the collection instead of repetitively against every member.   

In this revision, the observation result is an Object Property, in order to conform to strict OWL2 semantics. The type constraints on Observation specializations TruthObservation and CountObservation have been changed, so that the range of oml:result is an Object containing the xsd type, rather than the data-type itself.

A property type may be an operation or function such as a spatiotemporal coverage. Property-type definitions may be organized into a hierarchy or ontology and managed in a register and catalogued to support discovery functions. The observed property supports semantic or thematic classification of observations, which is useful for discovery and data fusion.

NOTE In general, the value of a specific observedProperty can be associated with different feature types in different observations, thus allowing the results of observations made in different projects or campaigns, and even from different disciplines, to be combined when required. A property-type register used in observations is most useful if each property type is not tied to a single feature type, or if equivalence relationships between similar property types from different feature types are provided.""" .

For some observations, this is identical to the phenomenonTime. However, there are important cases where they differ.

EXAMPLE 1 Where a measurement is made on a specimen in a laboratory, the phenomenonTime is the time the specimen was retrieved from its host, while the resultTime is the time the laboratory procedure was applied.

EXAMPLE 2 The resultTime also supports disambiguation of repeat measurements made of the same property of a feature using the same procedure.

EXAMPLE 3 Where sensor observation results are post-processed, the resultTime is the post-processing time, while the phenomenonTime is the time of initial interaction with the world.

EXAMPLE 4 Simulations can estimate the values for phenomena in the future or past. The phenomenonTime is the time that the result applies to, while the resultTime is the time that the simulation was executed.""" .

The purpose of an observation process is to generate an observation result. An instance of OM_Process is often an instrument or sensor, but may be a human observer, a simulator, or a process or algorithm applied to more primitive results used as inputs.

In SensorML, all components are modeled as processes. This includes components normally viewed as hardware, including transducers, actuators, and processors (which are viewed as process components) and sensors and platforms (which are modeled as systems). All components are modeled as processes that take input, and which through the application of an algorithm defined by a method and parameter values, generate output. All such components can therefore participate in process chains. Process chains are themselves processes with inputs, outputs, and parameters.

Hence, SensorML can be viewed as a specialized process description language with an emphasis on application to sensor data. Process descriptions in SensorML are agnostic of the development environment in which they might be executed, or the protocol by which data is transported between process execution modules. SensorML does not try to replace other existing technologies (such as BPEL or MATLAB Simulink). It is also conceived that SensorML-defined processes could be imported and executed within other execution environments, such as BPEL or MATLAB Simulink, as well as within SenosrML-enabled process execution software.""" .

The physical characteristics of the features themselves are of little interest, except perhaps to the manager of a sampling campaign.

EXAMPLE A “station” is essentially an identifiable locality where a sensor system or procedure may be deployed and an observation made. In the context of the observation model, it connotes the “world in the vicinity of the station”, so the observed properties relate to the physical medium at the station, and not to any physical artefact such as a mooring, buoy, benchmark, monument, well, etc.

NOTE A transient sampling feature, such as a ships-track or flight-line, might be identified and described, but is unlikely to be revisited exactly.

A sampling feature is intended to sample some feature-of-interest in an application domain, so there is an expectation of at least one sampledFeature property. However, in some cases the identity, and even the exact type, of the sampled feature may not be known when observations are made using the sampling features.""" ,

When observations are made to estimate properties of a geospatial feature, in particular where the value of a property varies within the scope of the feature, a spatial sampling feature is used. Depending on accessibility and on the nature of the expected property variation, the sampling feature may be extensive in one, two or three spatial dimensions. Processing and visualization methods are often dependent on the topological dimension of the sampling manifold, so this provides a natural classification system for sampling features.

This classification follows common practice in focussing on conventional spatial dimensions. Properties observed on sampling features may be time-dependent, but the temporal axis does not generally contribute to the classification of sampling feature classes. Sampling feature identity is usually less time-dependent than the property value.""" ;
